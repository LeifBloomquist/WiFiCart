Version 0.11 - WiFiModem-Menu-011.hex / WiFiModem-Hayes-011.hex
---------------------------------------------------------------
New:
-TODO menu: Improved telnet detection.  Eliminates delay when connecting to the modem
 from remote.
-TODO menu: File transfers over telnet should now work.  Previously only raw transfers
 were working reliably.  C64 terminal programs use raw.


Hayes:
-Fix for ATS2 command register for changing escape character.  The s register
 could be changed, but it had no effect.
-For ATS2 escape, a value of 128-255 now disables the escape code.
-PETSCII response fixes.
-OK/ERROR response fixes.
-Added AT&S0/1/2 to set DSR option.  
 &S0 = DSR always on
 &S1 = DSR will become active when carrier has been detected and
       inactive when carrier dropped.  Similar to DCD
 &S2 = Disable DSR line.  Set this when using UP9600.
-Fix for SSID / passphrase not being saved after being set.
-Removed 'CONNECTING...' message as it was interferring with telnet detection.
 Use AT*M= to set a message that will be displayed after a remote user 
 connects (incoming connections).
-DCD now defaults to inverted.  In Novaterm, select 'Normal' for carrier.
-AT command line can now contain non-AT command text before AT.  For example:
 abcATE0 is now accepted.  Required for some BBSs.


Version 0.10 - WiFiModem-Menu-010.hex / WiFiModem-Hayes-010.hex
---------------------------------------------------------------
New:

Hayes:
-Sending AT commands in uppercase PETSCII is now supported.  Response will 
 also be in PETSCII uppercase (0xc1-0xda) as seen on real modems.
-Removed PETSCII translation for text input and displayed text to save space.
 Use ASCII mode for setting the SSID / passphrase.
-Fix for modem not always going off-hook with ath1.
-ath0/1 now prints OK instead of NO CARRIER.
-auto-answer now prints RING before connecting.
-CommodoreServer.com 38,400 baud support.  See manual for details.
-ATS99 command register to disable AT ERROR responses.  Should only be used 
 when running a program that uses AT commands that are not supported by the
 modem and does not allow for the AT initialization string to be changed.
-Removed ATM0-3 support which did nothing but was previously added to prevent 
 an AT command error with BBSs that send it in the init string.  Use ATS99
 instead.
-Added AT*M= command to set a message that will be displayed after a remote 
 user connects (incoming connections).


Version 0.09 - WiFiModem-Menu-009.hex / WiFiModem-Hayes-009.hex

   X0 = 0-4
   X1 = 0-5, 10+
   X2 = 0-6, 10+

Version 0.05 - WiFiModem-Menu-005.hex / WiFiModem-Hayes-005.hex
---------------------------------------------------------------

-Automatic baud rate detection at boot.  When 'Baud Detection' appears on the display, you have three seconds to press a character on the keyboard to detect the speed.  It's recommended to press the letter 'u' as this should always detect the correct speed.  If you do not press a key it will use the previously detected baud rate.  Supports 1200, 2400, 9600, 19200.  Note:  There are known issues with 1200 baud support which are being investigated.  1200 baud support may be removed from future versions.
