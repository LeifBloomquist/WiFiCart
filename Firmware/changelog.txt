Version 0.05 - WiFiModem-Menu-005.hex / WiFiModem-Hayes-005.hex
---------------------------------------------------------------

-Automatic baud rate detection at boot.  When 'Baud Detection' appears on the display, you have three seconds to press a character on the keyboard to detect the speed.  It's recommended to press the letter 'u' as this should always detect the correct speed.  If you do not press a key it will use the previously detected baud rate.  Supports 1200, 2400, 9600, 19200.  Note:  There are known issues with 1200 baud support which are being investigated.  1200 baud support may be removed from future versions.

Menu only:
-Added +++ support to hang up the call.
-Changing the SSID / passphrase / key will now take effect immediately and a reboot is not required.

Hayes only:
-Removed menu system.  Device now boots directly to AT command mode.
-Fix for random crash/reboot
-at&k1 / at&k0 to enable / disable flow control
-Fix for dialing from terminal program.  If there are still issues, enable flow control (at&k1) or disable echo (ate0) and report it as a bug.
-Added at&raw to enter raw terminal mode
-Added at&ssid= at&pass= and at&key= to set WiFi
-Added at&w to save settings.  This is needed to save the WiFi settings.
-Added preliminary +++ support.  Currently hangs up but will be changed to drop to AT command mode in the future.
-Added phone book with auto-start.  Examples:
 -at&pb1=bbs.jammingsignal.com:23	Phone booke entry #1
